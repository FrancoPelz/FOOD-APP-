Blend anchovies, 2 cloves of the minced garlic, lemon juice, mustard, sugar, 6 tablespoons of the finely grated Parmesan, and the Worcestershire sauce until smooth.                                  With the blender running, stream in 1/2 cup olive oil until the dressing is thick and fully emulsified.                                  Brush chicken breasts with a few tablespoons of the dressing and grill or broil until cooked through. Cool and slice or chop.                                  Wash and dry lettuce, then cut it however you like (I prefer chopping it into 1-inch pieces).                                  Open baguette by cutting it in half, cut each half into 1-inch croutons, and toss it with 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 clove minced garlic. Bake in the preheated oven until crunchy, about 10 minutes (be careful to make sure the garlic doesn't burn!). Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of finely grated Parmesan on top of the croutons, then put back in oven until the cheese is melted.                                  Assemble the salad by dressing the romaine to taste, mixing in the croutons and the grilled chicken, and topping with shaved Parmesan. Enjoy!",
